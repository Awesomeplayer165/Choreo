## Zoom to fit Trajectory

This zooms to fit the trajectory of the focused path.

You can also access this option through the shortcut Control + 0 or Command + 0

## Path Gradients
Path Gradients are colors performed between intervals or between waypoints, depending on the specified behavior. This can be helpful for those trying to debug information quickly, or verify a constraint's effects.

### None
No path gradient applied.

### Velocity (Default Option)
Faster robot velocity is shown as green.

### Progress
Further progress through the path is shown as red.

### Acceleration
Faster robot acceleration is shown as green.

### Interval âˆ†t
Shorter time difference between intervals is shown as green
